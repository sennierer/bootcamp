# Data Science Bootcamp - Outline

## FIRST DAY

### Introduction to Machine Learning

Overview of machine learning, introduction to supervised vs. unsupervised learning concepts. Basics of classification vs. regression algorithms and how they can be used in real-world applications.

### Cleaning, Pre-Processing and Analyzing Data

Cleaning and mining of real-world data, pre-processing techniques. How to do exploratory data analysis with summary statistics and visualisation.

### Building Your First Classification Model

Building your first machine learning model for classification. Learning the K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and the how to measure its performance.

### Fine-Tuning Models

Improving your model with fine-tuning the model parameters and selecting the best variables. Introduction of the the bias-variance trade-off. 

### Mini-Project - Build Your Own Model

Build and optimise a classifier on new real-world data set.

### Evening Fun

Drinks with fellow participants and lecturers.

## SECOND DAY

### Classification with Decision Trees

Learn one of the most popular classification tool the decision trees (Decision Trees, Random Forests, Ensemble models, Extremely Randomised Trees).

### Clustering and Dimensionality reduction

Automatic grouping of similar objects into sets without any knowledge of how many categories you have. Learning how to visualize your results in 2D when you have many dimensions.

### Regression

Building prediction models with multivariable regression methods.

### Expert Talk and Panel Discussion

We invite Mariah Walton (Senior Data Scientist at LinkedIn) to share her experience on how to apply data science in business environments. After a presentation we will sit down with her for an open panel discussion about the field to answer any questions the participants may have.
