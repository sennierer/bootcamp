    "# Mini-Project - Build Your Own Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Â© 2016 STREAMBRIGHT DATA LLC, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal with this exercise to practice the skills and codes you have learned during today sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the next 1-2 hours you should build your own kNN classification models and fine-tune it to get the best scores for your classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the tasks you should do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* load the dataset that you will find in this folder called 'heart-disease.csv'\n",
    "* examine the different variables\n",
    "* clean the dataset\n",
    " * handle missing data\n",
    " * handle outliers if you find any\n",
    "* explore different visualizations to get familiar with the features\n",
    "* build a classification model (do not forget to split the data into training and test sets)\n",
    "* assess its classification power (use cross-validation)\n",
    "* fine-tune your model until you get the best performing one\n",
    " * tweek parameters (maybe use GridSearchCV)\n",
    " * play around with using only a subset or the features\n",
    " * transform features if necessary (scaling, log, sqrt), or just try out whether it increases the scoring power\n",
    " \n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    "* use the notebooks we have presented during the day to find the codes\n",
    "* use the packages' documentation if you get stuck\n",
    " * Numpy: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/\n",
    " * Pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/\n",
    " * Sci-kit Learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html\n",
    "* use google if you run into an error message or problem (http://stackoverflow.com/)\n",
    "* ask any of us if we are nearby! We are happy to help.\n",

    "**About the dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the \"Heart Disease Data Set\" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The \"num\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. Originally it was an integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. In this dataset it has been recoded to 0 and 1 - to simply attempt to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4 before now 1) from absence (value 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the 14 features we have in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "feature name | description\n",
    "-- | --\n",
    "age | age in years       \n",
    "sex | sex (1 = male; 0 = female)       \n",
    "cp | chest pain type (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)\n",
    "trestbps | resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "chol | serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "fbs | (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)  (1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "restecg | resting electrocardiographic results (Value 0: normal, Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)\n",
    "thalach | maximum heart rate achieved \n",
    "exang | exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
    "oldpeak | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "slope | the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)\n",
    "ca | number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy        \n",
    "thal | 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect\n",
    "num | Target label: 0 absence, 1 presence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally you can submit your final model for an evaluation. For the evaluation we will use separate dataset with new observations to avoid that you overfit the data to the evaluation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submisson should be a notebook containing the code from opening the dataset until the fitting of the model. Please make sure the object containing your model called 'knn'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also please create a list with the names of the features you use ( features = your_dataframe.columns )."
